# Findings

> What `/sdlc:ship`'s review found, one `## ` section a finding, written after every review and
> committed with the change. A rerun keeps each id, marks one the diff no longer shows `fixed`,
> and never raises again one answered `wrong`, `intentional` or `minor`. `sdlc.py` reads each
> heading and its `Evidence:`, `Class:`, `Disposition:` and `Reason:` lines, and `By: fresh` on a
> finding the fresh-context reviewer raised, counts them into the `Sdlc-Findings` trailer, and
> `ship` refuses while one is still `open`.
